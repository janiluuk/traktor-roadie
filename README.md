Add-on for Native Instruments DJ controllers. Works also if set as virtual controller.

- Dynamic LIVE playlists to Traktor with track suggestions based on your criterias. 
- Also broadcasts trackname to OBS for video streams.
- Provides realtime events for most of what's happening in Traktor, hook up and do your thing.
- No controller needed (but why?)
- To use it, run install script after backing up. Open traktor, add "D2" controller from "Add controller" section. To start broacasting, run the docker file.
- RUST environment might be needed if you want to recompile. Binary included.


Tested on Mac, not sure about windows. Tested on S4 and S5 controllers.
Open an Issue if yours don't work.
